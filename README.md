## Explain your research to a 6-year old ##

We used the [upgoer 5 text editor](https://splasho.com/upgoer5/) to summarise our research in 100 words, using only the 1000 most common words in English. Here are our efforts:

- [Moving your arm with small shocks](https://github.com/AbdnBiomechEng/upgoer-challenge/blob/main/arm-shock.md) by Ed.
- [Soft Robotics Elbow Orthotics](https://github.com/AbdnBiomechEng/upgoer-challenge/blob/main/elbow-device.md) by Michael.
